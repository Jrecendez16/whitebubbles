My name is Janet Ariana Recendez. I am 17 years old and an incoming senior\r\nat Trinity High School. I love my school because it is an all girls school and no I don't suffer because there are no guys around. I have one younger brother that is 15 that  also goes to a single-gendered school and yes he does suffer     hahaha. I live with my mom,  dad and my cute doggy cookie. I love music and Art as well as running and enjoy\r\n    traveling. Something that is on my bucket list is to travel the world. I love meeting\r\n    new people and learning about different cultures. I think it is exciting to find the \r\n    similarities and differences we all have. I also started playing around with making \r\n    websites and I think it is pretty cool too. So I applied to Girls Who Code and now\r\n    I am here learning all about computer science!\r\n    \r\n   This Is One of My GWC Projects I made\r\n    \r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13561451/9008813/6b1f7606-3762-11e5-8d17-8c9d08f1bc2c.png   ) \r\n\t\r\n\t","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
