My name is Janet Ariana Recendez. I am 17 years old and an incoming senior\r\n\tat Trinity High School. I love my school because it is an all girls school and no I \tdon't suffer because there are no guys around. I have one younger brother that is 15 that  \t\t         also goes to a single-gendered school and yes he does suffer hahaha. I live with my mom,\r\n\t   dad and my cute doggy cookie. I love music and Art as well as running and enjoy\r\n\ttraveling. Something that is on my bucket list is to travel the world. I love meeting\r\n    new people and learning about different cultures. I think it is exciting to find the \r\n    similarities and differences we all have. I also started playing around with making \r\n    websites and I think it is pretty cool too.
