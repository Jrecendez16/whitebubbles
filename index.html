<p>Hello! My name is Janet Ariana Recendez. I am 17 years old and an incoming senior
at Trinity High School. I love my school because it is an all girls school and no I don't suffer because there are no guys around. I have one younger brother that is 15 that  also goes to a single-gendered school and yes he does suffer     hahaha. I live with my mom,  dad and my cute doggy cookie. I love music and Art as well as running and enjoy
    traveling. Something that is on my bucket list is to travel the world. I love meeting
    new people and learning about different cultures. I think it is exciting to find the 
    similarities and differences we all have. I also started playing around with making 
    websites and I think it is pretty cool too. So I applied to Girls Who Code and now
    I am here learning all about computer science!</p>

<p>This Is One of My GWC Projects I made</p>
